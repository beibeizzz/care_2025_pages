## Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as the leading cause of death globally<d-cite key="whs1"></d-cite>, necessitate precise morphological and pathological quantification through segmentation of crucial cardiac structures from medical images<d-cite key="whs2"></d-cite>. However, whole heart segmentation (WHS) faces challenges including heart shape variability during the cardiac cycle, clinical artifacts like motion and poor contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as domain shifts in multi-center data and the distinct modalities of CT and MRI. CARE-Whole Heart serves to inspire innovative solutions in the realms of biomedical imaging and computer vision, striving to overcome these challenges and advance automated WHS for enhanced understanding and treatment of CVDs.


## Task
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="/assets/img/whs.png" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true max-width="70%" caption="Figure 1. Overview of CARE-Whole Heart" %}


The objective of this track is to achieve precise segmentation of seven substructures of the whole heart, with robustness against domain shifts (see Fig. 1).  
The specific substructures, each associated with a unique label value, are:

1. **Left Ventricular Blood Cavity (LV)** - Label value: 500
2. **Right Ventricular Blood Cavity (RV)** - Label value: 600
3. **Left Atrial Blood Cavity (LA)** - Label value: 420
4. **Right Atrial Blood Cavity (RA)** - Label value: 550
5. **Myocardium of the Left Ventricle (Myo)** - Label value: 205
6. **Ascending Aorta (AO)** - Label value: 820; defined as the aortic trunk from the aortic valve to the superior level of the atria.
7. **Pulmonary Artery (PA)** - Label value: 850; defined as the initial segment from the pulmonary valve to the bifurcation point.



**Note on Great Vessels:** The great vessels of interest, comprising the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery, are specifically defined due to variations in the fields of view across different scans. This uniform definition is crucial for ensuring consistency across evaluations. During the assessment, segmentation results for these vessels will be truncated to average lengths measured in healthy subjects, although participants are encouraged to extend their segmentation beyond these lengths. Our provided manual segmentations similarly cover more than the defined trunk measurements.

We will rank participant methods based on the settings (​Lb1–Lb4) detailed in the following table:

<div style="display: flex;">
<table class="table table-sm table-hover border-bottom" style="table-layout:fixed;width:85%;align:center;">
<caption style="caption-side: top; text-align: left; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px;width: 100%;"> Leaderboard (Lb) for CARE-Whole Heart track across modalities and evaluation settings.​​ Lb1–Lb4 represent performance from different test centers and modalities (e.g., Lb1 = CT segmentation peformance on center A and B). In-distribution refers to centers included in the training data, while out-of-distribution refers to unseen centers not used during training.</caption>

## Data

### About the data

**1) Dataset overview:** CARE-Whole Heart has **246** cases collected from **8** centers, supporting in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance evaluation for methods. Moreover, the diversity and clinical relevance of the dataset offers a broader spectrum of anatomical and pathological variations.

**2) Scanner:** Philips 64-slice CT scanner, SIEMENS SOMATOM Force CT scanner, GE Revolution_CT scanner, Philips Achieva 1.5T,
Siemens Avanto 1.5T, Toshiba Aquilion ONE CT scanner.

**3) Data format:** The data are all in Nifty format. Each training case has one CT or MRI scan with its corresponding label.
